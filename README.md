# Participium

Participium is a municipal service system that enables citizens to report local urban issues such as broken streetlights, waste management problems, road damage, or maintenance needs in public spaces.  
Municipal staff can review, approve, assign, and resolve reports through a structured workflow that automatically routes each issue to the appropriate technical office based on the problem category.

## System Features

- Citizen portal to submit detailed reports with description, photos, and precise location  
- Automatic category-based assignment to municipal technical offices  
- Staff dashboard for reviewing, approving, assigning, and resolving reports  
- Interactive map for viewing reports and creating new ones  

## Technical Offices and Responsibilities

The municipality includes several technical offices, each responsible for a specific area of public infrastructure.  
When a report is approved, the system assigns it to the correct office automatically.
